- **Click to View**: Click any order to open it in a new tab

## Files Modified

### `admin/orders.php`
1. **Added Modal HTML** (lines ~1559-1583)
   - New order notification modal with Bootstrap styling
   - Custom CSS for card layout and animations

2. **Added CSS Styles** (lines ~1585-1630)
   - Shake animation for bell icon
   - Card styling for order display
   - Hover effects and transitions

3. **Enhanced JavaScript** (lines ~1371-1496)
   - `showNewOrderModal(orders)` - Displays modal with new order details
   - Modified `pollOrdersTable()` - Detects and shows new orders
   - Tracks new orders and displays them in the modal

4. **Updated Notification Bell Dropdown** (lines ~495-511)
   - Enhanced styling with gradient header
   - Improved layout and spacing
   - Links to filtered pending orders page

5. **Enhanced Notification Functions** (lines ~1531-1631)
   - `fetchUnseenCount()` - Now fetches pending orders count
   - `fetchUnseenList()` - Displays pending orders with rich formatting
   - Added time ago calculation (e.g., "2 hours ago")
   - Enhanced hover effects and animations

### New Files Created

1. **`admin/get_pending_orders_count.php`**
   - Returns count of all pending orders
   - Used for the red badge counter

2. **`admin/get_pending_orders_list.php`**
   - Returns list of pending orders sorted by date (newest first)
   - Includes order details: ID, customer, amount, date, payment method
   - Supports limit parameter (default 10, max 50)

## How It Works

### Popup Modal System
1. **Polling**: The system polls `get_new_orders.php` every 2 seconds
2. **Detection**: Compares current orders with previously seen orders
3. **Notification**: When new orders are detected:
   - Plays notification sound (if available)
   - Shows popup modal with order details
   - Displays toast notification in top-right corner
   - Highlights new orders in the table
4. **Auto-dismiss**: Modal automatically closes after 15 seconds

### Notification Bell Dropdown
1. **Badge Counter**: 
   - Polls `get_pending_orders_count.php` every 5 seconds
   - Shows red badge with count of pending orders
   - Hides badge when count is 0
2. **Dropdown List**:
   - Fetches pending orders when bell icon is clicked
   - Calls `get_pending_orders_list.php?limit=10`
   - Displays orders in card format with hover effects
   - Shows "time ago" for each order (e.g., "2 hours ago")
3. **Click Action**: Opens order details in new tab

## Testing

### Test Popup Modal Notification:
1. Open the admin orders page: `http://localhost/capstone_php/admin/orders.php`
2. Keep the page open
3. Place a new order from the customer side
4. The popup modal should appear automatically showing the new order details

### Test Notification Bell Dropdown:
1. Open the admin orders page: `http://localhost/capstone_php/admin/orders.php`
2. Ensure there are pending orders in the system
3. Look for the red badge on the bell icon (shows count)
4. Click the bell icon to open the dropdown
5. See the list of pending orders sorted by date
6. Hover over orders to see hover effects
7. Click any order to open it in a new tab

## Optional Enhancement

To add a notification sound:
1. Place an MP3 file at: `assets/notification.mp3`
2. The system will automatically play it when new orders arrive
3. If the file doesn't exist, the system continues to work without sound

## Browser Compatibility

- Works with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses Bootstrap 5.3.2 for modal functionality

## Notes

- The modal uses `data-bs-backdrop="static"` to prevent accidental dismissal
- Multiple new orders are displayed in a scrollable list
- Each order card has a "View Order" button that opens in a new tab
- The system gracefully handles errors and continues polling even if requests fail
